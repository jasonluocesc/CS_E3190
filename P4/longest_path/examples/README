This is a collection of test data for the problem "longest_path" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data consists of directed graphs in DIMACS format.
A DIMACS file has the following format:

p e <number of nodes> <number of edges>
e <source node> <dest node>
e <source node> <dest node>
...
e <source node> <dest node>

The filenames have the form

	<int>.<int or 'cyclic'>.graph

where <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem), and
<int or 'cyclic'> is either the number of nodes along the longest path
or the string 'cyclic' if the graph is cyclic and therefore no longest
path exists.
