This is a collection of test data for the problem "shortest cycle" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data consists of undirected graphs in DIMACS format. A DIMACS file has
the following format:

p e <number of nodes> <number of edges>
e <source node> <dest node>
e <source node> <dest node>
...
e <source node> <dest node>

These graphs are undirected, but the edges are only marked in one
direction (it should be assumed they go both ways).

The filenames have the form

	<int>.<int or 'acyclic'>.graph

where <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem), and
<int or 'acyclic'> is either the length of the shortest cycle or the string
'acyclic' if the graph is acyclic and therefore no shortest cycle exists.
