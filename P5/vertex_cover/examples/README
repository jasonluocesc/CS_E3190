This is a collection of test data for the problem "vertex_cover" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data consists of directed graphs in DIMACS format.
A DIMACS file has the following format:

p e <number of nodes> <number of edges>
e <source node> <dest node>
e <source node> <dest node>
...
e <source node> <dest node>

These graphs are undirected, but the edges are only marked in one
direction (but it should be assumed they go both ways).
