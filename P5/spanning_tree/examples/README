This is a collection of test data for the problem "spanning_tree" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data consists of directed, weighted graphs in DIMACS format.
A DIMACS file has the following format:

p e <number of nodes> <number of edges>
e <source node> <dest node> <weight>
e <source node> <dest node> <weight>
...
e <source node> <dest node> <weight>

These graphs are undirected, but the edges are only marked in one
direction (but it should be assumed they go both ways).
