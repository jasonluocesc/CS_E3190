This is a collection of test data for the problem "mod_mult_inverse" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data files use the following format:

	a prime

where
	a : integer
		in [1, p-1]
	prime : integer, also prime number

The filenames are formatted as

	<int>.<int>.instance

where the first <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem),
and the second <int> marks the solution of the problem instance.

The contents of the file are meant to be used as command line parameters. One
system-dependent way to pass them to your program from the command line would
be

	python mod_mult_inverse.py $(cat 01.5817.instance)
