This is a collection of test data for the problem "topological_sorting" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data consists of directed graphs in DIMACS format.
A DIMACS file has the following format:

p e <number of nodes> <number of edges>
e <source node> <dest node>
e <source node> <dest node>
...
e <source node> <dest node>

The filenames have the form

	<int>.<'cyclic' or 'acyclic'>.graph

where <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem). For cyclic
graphs, no topological sorting exists, and for the acyclic ones, your program
should be able to find one.
