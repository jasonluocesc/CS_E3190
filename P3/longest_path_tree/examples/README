This is a collection of test data for the problem "longest_path_tree" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data consists of directed graphs in DIMACS format.
A DIMACS file has the following format:

p e <number of nodes> <number of edges>
e <source node> <dest node>
e <source node> <dest node>
...
e <source node> <dest node>

These graphs are undirected, but the edges are only marked in one
direction (but it should be assumed they go both ways).

The filenames are formatted as

	<int>.<'d'+<int> or 'cyclic'>.graph

where <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem), and
<int or 'cyclic'> is either the number of nodes along the longest path
(i.e., along the diameter) or the string 'cyclic' if the graph is cyclic
and therefore no longest path exists.
