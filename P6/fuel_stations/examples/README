This is a collection of test data for the problem "fuel_stations" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The files have the following format:
<minimum distance between stations> <total number of locations>
<dist_1> <dist_2> ... <dist_n>
<profit_1> <profit_2> ... <profit_n>

where dist_i is the distance to the i-th location from the beginning of
the road, and profit_i is the profit one gets from setting up a fuel
station at location i.

All values are integers. For more information, see the instructions for
this assignment.
