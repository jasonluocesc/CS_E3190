This is a collection of test data for the problem "odd_numbers" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data files use the following format:

	a_1 a_2 ... a_n

where a_1 ... a_n are all integers.

The filenames are formatted as

	<int>.<int>.instance

where the first <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem),
and the second <int> marks the solution of the problem instance.
