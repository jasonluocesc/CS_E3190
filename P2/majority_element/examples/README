This is a collection of test data for the problem "majority_element" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data consists of numbers indicating the value of an element.
An instance file has the following format:

<number> <number ... <number>

The filenames are formatted as

	<int>.<int or none>.instance

where <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem), and
<int or none> marks the solution of the problem instance.
