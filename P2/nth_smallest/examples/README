This is a collection of test data for the problem "nth_smallest" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data files use the following format:

	n a_1 a_2 ... a_n b_1 b_2 ... b_n

where n, a_i and b_i are all integers. a_1 ... a_n, and b_1 ... b_n are two
sorted arrays that both have the size n.

The filenames are formatted as

	<int>.<int>.instance

where the first <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem),
and the second <int> marks the solution of the problem instance.
