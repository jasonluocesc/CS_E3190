This is a collection of test data for the problem "index-value pairs" in
the course CS-E3190 Principles of Algorithmic Techniques.

The data files use the following format:

	n x_1 x_2 x_3 ... x_n

where n and all x_i are integers. The integers x_i are sorted from smallest to
largest.

The filenames are formatted as

	<int>.<int or none>.instance

where <int> is just an index number (not relevant to the problem), and
<int or none> marks the solution of the problem instance.
